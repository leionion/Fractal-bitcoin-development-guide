## Fractal Bitcoin Development Guide

This guide serves as a comprehensive guide to the Fractal Bitcoin network.
 This includes the implementation of features such as the CAT20 token protocol, sCrypt smart contract development via OP_CAT, and exploration of the Ordinal, BRC-20, and Rune protocols.


I am a blockchain developer with four years of experience, primarily working within the Bitcoin and Solana ecosystems. This guide is a work in progress and may encounter unexpected challenges. Therefore, users are advised to critically evaluate and reference this material. Updates will be provided as new announcements and technologies emerge within the Fractal Bitcoin ecosystem.
